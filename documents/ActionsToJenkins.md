# Github Actions to Jenkins

While GitHub Actions and Jenkins are both popular CI/CD tools, we've made the
choice to switch to Jenkins.

- Greater Flexibility: Jenkins provides greater flexibility and customization options compared to GitHub Actions. Jenkins is an open-source tool, and developers can write custom plugins to extend its functionality, while GitHub Actions is a proprietary tool with more limited options for customization.

- Better Integration with Legacy Systems: Jenkins has been around for much longer than GitHub Actions, and as a result, it has better integration capabilities with legacy systems. If a company has existing infrastructure or tools that are compatible with Jenkins, it may be more efficient to use Jenkins instead of investing in new technologies to support GitHub Actions.

- More Comprehensive Build Pipelines: Jenkins has a more comprehensive set of features for building and deploying applications, such as support for parallel builds, distributed builds, and multiple triggers. While GitHub Actions has similar features, Jenkins has been around for much longer and has a more mature ecosystem.

- Better Support for Large-Scale Projects: Jenkins is designed to handle large-scale projects with multiple components, while GitHub Actions is more geared towards smaller projects with simpler workflows. If a company has a large-scale project with complex workflows and multiple components, Jenkins may be a better choice.

- Better Control over Security: Jenkins provides better control over security compared to GitHub Actions. With Jenkins, the company has full control over the infrastructure and can implement security measures such as firewalls, access controls, and user permissions. While GitHub Actions also provides security features, the company has less control over the underlying infrastructure.

- Better Support for Multiple Platforms: Jenkins supports multiple platforms, including Linux, Windows, and macOS, while GitHub Actions has limited support for Windows and macOS. If a company needs to build and deploy applications across multiple platforms, Jenkins may be a better choice.

- It's important to note that while there may be reasons to switch from GitHub Actions to Jenkins, each tool has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the decision should be based on the specific needs and requirements of the company.
