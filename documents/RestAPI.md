# Why we are switching to Rest API from GraphQL

- Better support for caching: REST API has been around for much longer and has better support for caching compared to GraphQL. Caching can help improve the performance of the API by reducing the number of requests made to the server. If caching is a critical requirement for the project, migrating to REST API could be a better choice.

- Reduced complexity: GraphQL can be more complex to implement, especially if the project requires complex queries or nested relationships. REST API, on the other hand, can be more straightforward to implement for simpler use cases.

- Easier Integration with Legacy Systems: If a company has legacy systems that only support REST APIs, it may be more cost-effective to use REST APIs instead of investing in new technologies and infrastructure to support GraphQL.

- Wider Adoption: REST APIs have been around for much longer and are more widely adopted compared to GraphQL. As a result, there is a larger pool of developers who are familiar with REST APIs, and there are more tools and resources available to support REST APIs.

- Performance Optimization: REST APIs have been around for a long time, and there are many proven techniques for optimizing their performance, such as caching and content delivery networks. While GraphQL is designed to be more efficient in some cases, it may not always be the best choice for high-performance applications.

- Simpler Implementation: REST APIs are generally considered simpler to implement than GraphQL, which can be more complex, especially for developers who are new to the technology. If a company has limited resources or a tight timeline, it may be more efficient to use REST APIs instead of investing time and resources into learning and implementing GraphQL.

- More Robust Error Handling: REST APIs have a more well-established error handling mechanism that can help companies identify and address issues more quickly. GraphQL has a more flexible error handling mechanism, but it can be more difficult to troubleshoot errors.

- Better Support for Integration with Third-Party Tools: Many third-party tools and platforms have built-in support for REST APIs, which can make it easier to integrate with these tools. While GraphQL is gaining popularity, it may not yet have the same level of support from third-party tools and platforms.
