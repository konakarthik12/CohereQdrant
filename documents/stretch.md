Guide: How to Stretch During a Long Office Day

Sitting at a desk for long periods of time can cause stiffness and discomfort in your muscles. Here are a few stretches you can do throughout the day to help alleviate tension:

Neck Stretch: Gently tilt your head to the right, bringing your right ear toward your right shoulder. Hold for a few seconds, then repeat on the other side.

Shoulder Rolls: Roll your shoulders forward in a circular motion, then backward. Repeat several times.

Seated Hamstring Stretch: Sit on the edge of your chair and extend one leg out in front of you with your heel on the ground. Keeping your back straight, lean forward until you feel a stretch in the back of your leg. Hold for 10-15 seconds, then switch legs.

Wrist and Finger Stretches: Interlace your fingers in front of you with your palms facing away from your body, then gently push your hands forward to stretch your wrists. Next, spread your fingers apart and hold for a few seconds, then make a fist and hold for a few seconds.

Remember to take breaks throughout the day to stand up and walk around, and to stretch your legs, arms and back.
