# Switching from in house servers to AWS

In an effort to grow faster, we've made the decision to move to AWS.

Scalability: In-house servers are limited by physical infrastructure and can only handle a certain amount of traffic and data processing. With AWS, developers can easily scale up or down their computing resources to meet the demands of their applications, without the need for additional hardware.

Cost-effectiveness: Building and maintaining an in-house server infrastructure can be expensive, requiring significant upfront costs for hardware, software licenses, and ongoing maintenance. With AWS, developers can pay for what they use, only paying for the computing resources they need at any given time.

High Availability: AWS provides multiple availability zones across the globe, ensuring that applications are highly available and accessible to users, even in the event of a data center failure. This level of redundancy is difficult and expensive to replicate with an in-house infrastructure.

Security: AWS provides a wide range of security features, including encryption, access control, and monitoring tools, which can help developers protect their applications and data from external threats. In-house server setups require additional resources and expertise to ensure similar levels of security.

Flexibility: AWS provides a wide range of services, including compute, storage, and database offerings, that can be quickly and easily integrated into applications. This flexibility allows developers to build and deploy applications more quickly and efficiently than they could with an in-house infrastructure.

Global Reach: AWS has a vast global network of data centers, making it easy for developers to deploy applications and services in multiple regions around the world. This global reach can help companies expand their businesses and reach new customers.
