# Optimizing server costs AWS [Guide]

* Optimize network usage: Minimize network traffic by using content delivery networks (CDNs) and caching. Also, make sure to review and optimize data transfer costs, especially for large file transfers or for data transfer between different regions or providers.
* Optimize storage usage: You can optimize storage usage by compressing data, removing unused files, and using cheaper storage options for less frequently accessed data. Also, consider using backup and archive solutions that are optimized for long-term storage.
* Monitor resource utilization: Keeping track of server utilization can help you identify which resources are underutilized or overutilized. You can then make adjustments, such as reducing the number of virtual machines running or resizing instances, to optimize resource usage and minimize costs.
* Use automation: Automating processes can help you avoid human error and optimize server usage. For example, you can set up auto scaling groups to automatically adjust the number of instances based on demand, or use serverless computing to automatically allocate resources when needed.
* Use reserved instances: Cloud providers offer discounts for reserved instances, which are instances that you commit to using for a certain period of time. By committing to use instances for longer periods, you can reduce costs and get more predictable pricing.
* Use cost optimization tools: Cloud providers offer cost optimization tools that can help you analyze your usage and identify opportunities for cost savings. Use these tools to regularly review your usage and make adjustments as needed.
